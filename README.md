# Title of the project
**Progressive Web Application for Job Coaching and Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities (SIH1333)**

# Description
Our solution is a web-based service that uses AI and machine learning to align with government policies and social initiatives to enhance employment prospects for people with disabilities (PwDs). The model is designed to provide a comprehensive set of resources and supports tailored to the unique needs of PwDs. Here is an overview of the main components:

**1. Individual Job Suggestions:** Users can create detailed information, including skills, qualifications, location and disability criteria. Machine learning algorithms analyze this information and provide personalized action recommendations. Timely reporting ensures that users are notified of appropriate privileges.

**2. Simplified Job Descriptions:** The GPT-3-based model provides simple job descriptions specifically designed for PwDs, including those with intellectual disabilities, autism spectrum disorders, multiple disabilities, mental health, and including specific learning disabilities. Speech recognition and multilingual chatbots provide business guidance.

**3. Test preparation and progress tracking:** The platform provides test preparation support and tracks user progress, including tasks used, tests attended, and qualifying or pending interviews.

**4. Workplace Flexibility Assistance:** When a user finds a job, he/she can apply for workplace flexibility or accommodation assistance to enhance his/her work experience.

**5. Interactive Community Section:** The app has an interactive community section where users can interact with their peers and mentors. A supportive community can be created by sharing success stories, tips and resources.
**6. Blockchain-based authentication:** To ensure a formal and transparent recruitment process, the platform uses blockchain-based authentication to verify the qualifications obtained by PwDs candidates true.
